<div class="textBox">
	<div class="headerBox">Settings Nash Calculations Style Sheet</div>

	here you may adjust the style sheet for the nash calculations in the <a href="handViewer.html">Hand viewer</a> tab.
	<br>
	<br>

	i assume you are familiar the with style sheets and know what you are doing when editing the box. you may
	<b>Open</b> a style sheet, you may <b>Save</b> the current one to file or <b>Restore</b> the default one.

	<div class="noteBox">
		<ul>
			<li>changes will take effekt on the next hand that is loaded
			<li>the default style sheet may change with every relase. so it is maybe be a good idea to save your changes
				to file and restore default to see what changed in new releases.
		</ul>
