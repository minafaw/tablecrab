<div class="textBox">
	<div class="headerBox">Hand Viewer</div>

	This tab is a bit special. behind the sceeneds there is a grabber running that will check if instant hand history  is open. if so, the
	currently selected hand is dumped nicely formatted to this tab. best use along with <a href="hotkeyInstantHandHistory.html">
	hotkey Instant Hand History</a> as a replacement for PokerStars replayer. the hand viewer may be adjusted via <a href="settingsHandViewer.html">
	settings hand viewer</a> and <a href="settingsHandViewerStyleSheet.html">settings hand viewer style sheet</a>.
	<br>
	<br>

	<div class="noteBox">
		<ul>
			<li>the viewer only works for Texas Hold'em and Omaha (nl/pl)
			<li>make shure &quot;Show Summary Only&quot; is unchecked in PokerStars
			instant hand hitory
		</ul>
	</div>


	if the hand is a <b>sitNgo </b> hand you may fetch nash calculations for it from
	<b>HoldcemResources.net</b>. to do so either select a payout structure
	or fill in a custom one. this automatically triggers fetching of stats on every new
	hand loaded.
	<br>
	<br>

	if everthing goes well the data for the hand will be displayed in the side bar
	as taken from HoldemResources.net icm calculator. you may stop fetching data
	at any time by selecting &quot;None&quot; from the combo box.

	<div class="noteBox">
	<ul>
			<li>the data is fetched from the internets - this may take some time or may fail
					at any time. so browsing a hand history file may become considerably slower
			<li>the hand viewer does not know if the hand history displayed is	actually a sitNgo
					hand. if you fetch data for a non sitNgo hands results are undefined.
			<li>fetching does not work with hands you load from disk
		</ul>
