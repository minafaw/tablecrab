<div class="textBox">
	<div class="headerBox">Hotkey Fold</div>

	whenever you hit this key TableCrab will fold the hand for you. that is - it either hits the <i>"Fold"</i> button or checks the <i>"Fold"</i> checkbox.

</div>

<div class="noteBox">
		<ul>
			<li>currently checkbox fold AND button fold have to be in the same location
			       to make this hotkey work. this may or may not get fixed in future releases
			       to support layouts that do not meet this condition. for now just make shure
			       both points as specified in the template are within the bounds of button
			       AND checkbox.
		</ul>
</div>
