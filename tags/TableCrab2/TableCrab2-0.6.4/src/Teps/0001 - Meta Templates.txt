proposal - Meta Templates or template factory
===============================

currently TableCrab has no easy way to add custom templates. it is limited
to one site, that is PokerStars and all of the funktionallity is hard coded. this Tep
suggest to abstract templates so that they can be dynamically created and adjusted
by the user to (potentially) add support for any thinkable poker site.

analysis:
each widget we work with has a set of properties to identify it and a set of features
that the user may interact with. simplest case a message box: identifying properties
could be its title and buttons present. features we expose may be "click button X"
or "close message box". this can be abstracted to to four steps:

1. property extraction
2. property analysis
3. feature analysis
4. feature interaction



property etraction
----------------------------
properties widgets expose:
   - title (platform independend)
   - className (platform dependend)
   - executableName (platform dependend?)
   - size and position (platform independend)
   - subWidgets present (platform dependend)
   - parentWidgets(s) (platform dependend)
   - ...
   - at tables information when its the players turn to act

- platforms: properties may or may not beavailable on certain platforms. where platforms
   can be windows vs linux vs wine vs mac. or Qt based clients (FullTilt for example) vs
   win32api based clients and what else not. so we'd may have to limitplatforms we
   want to support or not.

"information when its the players turn to act" is the crucial information. certain
controls may only be visible "in turn" or "out of turn". TableCrab currently does this
for PokerStars tables by checking the property "visible" for the bet box. this is
insufficient but works for now (insufficient because he bet box may not always be
visible when its the players turn).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
we need a better mechanism to extract property "players turn".
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

once this property is extracted more reliably we got hands free to implement
what this draft is about: Meta Templates



property analysis
-------------------------------
once we extracted properties the analysis could be handed out to the user to let
him identify widgets of interest.



feature analysis
--------------------------------
1. automatic extraction as outlined in "property extraction"
2. user supplied features

for a poker table we need:
- positions of controls (user supplied)
- position of pot (user supplied)
- size of pot
-size of current bet
- ...



feature interaction
--------------------------------------

- mouse interaction
- keyboard interaction
- ...


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
once this analysis is complete we could implement user adjustable meta templates.
each meta template would require the user to supply information on how to identify a
widget of interest and eventually supply features of this widget we can not dectect
automatically. these meta templates then could be made available to fill in user supplied
features on a dedicated widget or, if no user supplied features are necessary, to automatically
trigger user defined actions on the widget. this would make the current "PokerStars
table template" superfluous + all the actions on message boxes in favour of a more
generic mechanism.



PROS: generic, could add support for all poker sites out of the box
CONS: hard to implement, result could be too hard to learn for average users
TODO ON THIS DRAFT: loads
