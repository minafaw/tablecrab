<div class="textBox">
	<div class="headerBox">Hotkey Bet Pot</div>

	puts current pot amount multiplied by <b>Multiplier</b> into the bet box.	use this
	hotkey for 1/1 1/2 (...) pot sized bets. a multiplier of 0.5 for example is a good
	choice for a hotkey to make half pot sized bets.

	<br><br>
	to use this hotkey you have to tell TableCrab where the pot is. every template on the
	<a href="setup.html">Setup</a>	tab has two points for this: <b>PotTopLeft</b> and
	<b>PotBottomRigth</b>. doubleclick on the locations on the screenshot. add some
	space to the left and right as shown below just to make shure the region is still covered
	in case PokerStars needs to resize the pot to make room for bigger bets.

	<br><br>
	<pre style="font-family: courier">

    PotTopLeft
    \
     x       ______________
            |              |
            | POT $15,500  |
            |______________|
                                x

		<ul>
		<li>this hotkey may or may not work depending on your table theme. you have
		to find out yourself. in the background an ocr engine tries its best to make sense
		out of the region you pointed it to. watch the messages on the status bar to get
an idea if things are working for you or not.

		<br><br>
		as a rule of thumb: a highly contrasing background is better than low contrasting one.
		a plain as background is better than a rough.
