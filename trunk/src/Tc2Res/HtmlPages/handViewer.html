	This tab is a bit special. behind the sceeneds there is a grabber running that will check if instant hand history  is open. if so, the
	currently selected hand is dumped nicely formatted to this tab. best use along with <a href="hotkeyInstantHandHistory.html">
	hotkey Instant Hand History</a> as a replacement for PokerStars replayer. the hand viewer may be adjusted via <a href="settingsHandViewer.html">
	settings hand viewer</a> and <a href="settingsHandViewerStyleSheet.html">settings hand viewer style sheet</a>.
	hitting <b>Ctrl+F</b> will show the text search bar.

	<div class="noteBox">
		<ul>
			<li>the viewer only works for Texas Hold'em and Omaha (nl/pl)
			<li>make shure &quot;Show Summary Only&quot; is unchecked in PokerStars
			instant hand hitory
		</ul>
	</div>

<div class="textBox">
	<div class="headerBox">Side bars</div>

	the hand viewer supports the following side bars:


	<div class="textBox">
		<div class="headerBox">Fetch nash calculations</div>

		if the hand is a <b>sitNgo </b> hand you may fetch nash calculations for it from
		<b>HoldcemResources.net</b>. to do so either select a payout structure
		or fill in a custom one. this automatically triggers fetching of stats on every new
		hand loaded.
		<br>
		<br>

		if everthing goes well the data for the hand will be displayed in the side bar
		as taken from HoldemResources.net icm calculator. you may stop fetching data
		at any time by selecting the topmostentry in the combo box.

		<div class="noteBox">
		<ul>
				<li>the data is fetched from the internets - this may take some time or may fail
						at any time. so browsing a hand history file may become considerably slower
				<li>the hand viewer does not know if the hand history displayed is	actually a sitNgo
						hand. if you fetch data for a non sitNgo hands results are undefined.
				<li>fetching does not work with hands you load from disk
			</ul>

	</div>
	
	<div class="textBox">
		<div class="headerBox">ICM-tax viewer</div>

		if the hand is a <b>sitNgo </b> hand you may display a table of ICM-taxes for the individual players.
		to do so either select a payout structure or fill in a custom one. this automatically 
		triggers the calculation of the table.
		<br>
		<br>

		in the table ICM-taxes (that is penalties) are displayed as a quotient hero vs villain.
		the first number is tax hero pays versus villain, the second the tax villain pays
		vs hero. for example if the table reads: SB-->BB == 64/43, SB pays 64% tax
		and BB  pays 43% tax. so BB should be more happy to get his chips in than
		SB but on the bottom line both players pay a heavy price for doing so.
