	whenever you hit this key the current table will be resized to the size of the next template
	on the <a href="setup.html">Setup</a> tab.  for example, if you have two templates of
	different sized tables you can use this hotkey to toggle your tables size on the fly.

		<li>linux users: this hotkey does nothing in <b>wine-1.4.2</b> up to <b>wine-1.3.0</b>. you may have to upgrade wine.
			currently there is no release > 1.3.0 so you have to grab and compile wine directly from the repositiory.
