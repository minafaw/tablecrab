additional hotkeys for PokerStars and more

WARNING: this thingy is pretty alpha - so use at your own risk

--------------------------
features:
--------------------------

- hotkeys for table actions like fold, check, raise, alter bet amount, show replayer
- auto-close popup news if desired

---------------------------
usage:
---------------------------

linux:
- install wine
- install the windows version of python (>= 2.6) from [http://python.org/download/]
- run from commandline: 
    >> wine pathTo/python.exe pathTo/Cli.py pathTo/my.cfg
	
	where "pathTo/my.cfg" is the path to your configuration file. if omitted the default config
	from User/default.cfg is taken. for details see User/default.cfg
	
	in case an error occurs a report should be written to User/errlog.txt. please include
	this file in any failure reports
	

win32:
- not tested but may work as expected


--------------------------
notes:
--------------------------

- when running in wine, if "Allow the window manager to control the windows" is set to False, the
   foreground window may or may not be the window you see in the foregrond. therefore hotkeys
    may or may not work   
 
 - another wine specific: on my ubuntu box wine took the first keyboard layout it could get a hold on. had
    to remove US keyboard layout to get wine to use the desired german one.
