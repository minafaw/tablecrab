we serve pages from python resource modules (PyInstaller troubles) so..

to reference a page you have to use:
	TableCrab://HtmlPage/myPageName
	
to reference an image you have to use:
	TableCrab://Pixmap/myPixmapName
	

..and use the internal help viewer to view them. 

NOTE: changes will not get reflected unless you regenerate the resources via "GenResources.py" in the parent directory
