<div class="textBox">
	<div class="headerBox">Settings Hand Css</div>

	here you may adjust the style sheet for the <a href="hand.html">Hand</a> tab.
	<br>
	<br>
	
	i assume you are familiar the with Css format and know what you are doing when editing the box. you may
	<b>Open</b> a style sheet, you may <b>Save</b> the current one to file or <b>Restore</b> the default one.
	
	<div class="noteBox">
	<ul>
			<li>changes will take effekt on the next hand that is loaded
		</ul>i may make adjustements to the default Css on every TableCrab release. so it may be a good idea
				to save the current Css and hit <b>Restore Default</b> from time to time to see what has changed.
