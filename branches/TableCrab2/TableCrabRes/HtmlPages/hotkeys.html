<div class="textBox">
	<div class="headerBox">Hotkeys</div>

	to setup a hotkey select <b>&quot;New&quot;</b> from the toolbar and fill in the dialog that pops up.
	to assign keyboard keys select the <b>&quot;Hotkey&quot;</b> box in the dialog and start typing the
	desired keys or key combinations on your keyboard.
	<br>
	<br>
	the keys you entered may look funny. &quot;&lt;LeftControl+Oem-Period&gt;&quot; for example. this is because
	TableCrab is too lazy to look up the keys as they read on your keyboard. use the <b>&quot;Hotkey Name&quot;</b>
	box to overwrite with a name of your choice. for the above key &quot;LeftCtrl+Period&quot; could be a nice name. 
	<br>
	<br>
	some special keys can be found in the dropdown of the <b>&quot;Hotkey&quot;</b> box:
	<ul>
			<li><b>MouseWheelUp</b> - triggers the action when the mouse wheel is scolled upwards
			<li><b>MouseWheelDown</b> -  - triggers the action when the mouse wheel is scolled downwards
			<li>keys that would trigger actions in the dialog when you would try to enter them
		</ul>
	you can always go back to entering keys directly from your keyboard by selecting the first
	item in the dropdown.
	
	
	<div class="noteBox">
	<ul>
			<li>you can setup up to 64 hotkeys
			<li><b>&quot;LeftControl&quot;</b> is <b>&quot;left control key&quot;</b>. that is left not right. same goes for all
			other keys that have left and a right representation on your keyboard.
			<li>TableCrab does not check for conflicting hotkeys. it always takes the first one in the list if in doubt.
			<li>you can not assign the following keys:  <b>Shift</b>, <b>Scroll</b>, <b>Numlock</b> and  
			<b>Capital</b>. TableCrab ignores these keys and does not know if they are locked on your keyboard
			or not.
			<li>hotkeys are disabled as long as the mouse is over the chat or notes box.
