	Welcome to TableCrab. TableCrab is a hotkey manager for PokerStars including some extras.
	
	<ul>
		<li>it is developed and tested on linux and thus runs on wine
		<li>it is tested on windowsXP
		<li>it comes equipped with a <a href="hand.html">hand</a> viewer to replace PokerStars replayer
		<li>...
	</ul>
	
	TableCrab does not know much about PokerStars tables. it works on fixed sized windows and clicks
	buttons at positions you  specify.  to do so you have to define one or more templates in the 
	<a href="setup.html">setup</a> tab and use PokerStars custom layouts to keep the tables at a fixed size.
	<br>
	<br>
	
	
	after doing so you can start setting up hotkeys on the <a href="hotkeys.html">hotkeys</a> tab.
