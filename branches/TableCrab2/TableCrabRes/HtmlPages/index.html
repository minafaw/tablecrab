	Welcome to TableCrab. TableCrab is a hotkey manager for PokerStars including some extras.
	
	<ul>
		<li>it is developed and tested on linux and thus runs on wine
		<li>it is tested on windowsXP
		<li>it comes equipped with a <a href="hand.html">hand</a> viewer to replace PokerStars replayer
		<li>...
	</ul>
	
	TableCrab does not know much about PokerStars tables. so to make TableCrab work you
	have to define one or more tables on the <a href="setup.html">setup</a> tab.
	<br>
	<br>
	after doing so you can start setting up hotkeys for the tables on the <a href="hotkeys.html">hotkeys</a> tab.
