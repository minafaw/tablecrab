<div class="textBox">
	<div class="headerBox">Settings Hand</div>

	here you can fine tune what is displayed in the <a href="hand.html">Hand</a> tab
	<br>
	<br>
	
	<b>Prefix | Action | Postfix</b>
	<br>
	you may adjust prefixes and postixes for actions. for example a bet is displayed as &quot;b100&quot;.
	set prefix to &quot;bets(&quot; and postfix to &quot;)&quot; and the action will be displayed as 
	&quot;bets(100)&quot;.
	<br>
	<br>
	
	
	<b>Max Player Name</b>
	<br>
	here you may adjust the maximum lenght of player names. if a player name is longer than
	this number of chars it will get truncated. set to -1 to not truncate at all.
	<br>
	<br>
	
	<b>Floating point to integer</b>
	<br>
	if checked, TableCrab will try its best automatically convert floating point bet amounts and stack sizes to
	integer values. maybe helpful at the micros.
