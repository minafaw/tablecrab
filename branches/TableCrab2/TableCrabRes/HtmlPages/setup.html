	as said, TableCrab does not know much about tables. it does not try to guess where buttons
	or checkboxes are. it can only work on fixed sized windows and fixed positions. for this you 
	have to set up templates for. 
	<br>
	<br>
	the process is fairly simple. create a new template and sit at a table. hit the <a href="hotkeyScreenshot.html">
	screenshot</a> hotkey when buttons become visible and go back to the setup tab. select the button or checkbox 
	in the template you want to assign and double click the corrosponding corrosponding button or checkbox on
	the screeenshot. this will fill in the point clicked in the template. you may need more than one screenshot. and it's a 
	good idea to save them for later use.
	<br>
	<br>
	
	use PokerStars custom layouts to make shure your tables are of a fixed size because ..if you loose your tables 
	layout you are a bit out of luck. you may have to setup a new template or fiddle around to get the window to match 
	the size of the template again.
	
	
	<div class="noteBox">
		<ul>
			<li>you can setup up to 64 templates
			<li>TableCrab does not check for conflicting templates. it always takes the first one in the list if in doubt.
			<li>a template will only work for a table of <b>size</b>
			<li>buttons or chekboxes with a location of <b>None</b> will be ignored
			<li>to reset a point hold down <b>Ctrl</b> when double clicking
			<li>all sizes and positions are relative to the client area of a window - that is the windows size minus title bar, menu bar and borders
		</ul>

	on the staus bar the name of the current screenshot is displayed along with its size and the mouse position inside the screenshot.

	if the mouse is over another window the same data is displayed for the window. <b>Note:</b> this part of the 
	feature will be removed in  future versions. you can use it to try to adjust a window to match a templates
	size. future versions will add support to do this via hotkey. currently a bug in wine prevents this.
