	as said, TableCrab does not know much about tables. it does not try to guess where buttons
	or checkboxes are. it can only work on fixed sized windows and fixed positions. for this you 
	have to set up templates for. 
	<br>
	<br>
	the process is fairly simple. create a new template and sit at a table. hit the <a href="hotkeyScreenshot.html">
	screenshot</a> hotkey when buttons become visible and go back to the setup tab. select the button or checkbox 
	in the template you want to assign and double click the corrosponding corrosponding button or checkbox on
	the screeenshot. this will fill in the location in the template. you may need more than one screenshot. and it's a 
	good idea to save them for later use.


	<div class="noteBox">
		<ul>
			<li>you can setup up to 64 templates
			<li>TableCrab does not check for conflicting templates. it always takes the first one in the list if in doubt.
			<li>use PokerStars custom layouts to make shure your tables are of a fixed size because..
			<li>a template will only work for a table of its size
			<li>buttons or chekboxes with a location of "None" will be ignored
		</ul>
