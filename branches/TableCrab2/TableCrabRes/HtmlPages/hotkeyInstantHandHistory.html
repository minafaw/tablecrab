<div class="textBox">
	<div class="headerBox">Hotkey Instant hand History</div>

	this hotkey clicks the instant hand history button at the table. use it to open/refresh the instant
	hand history.

	<div class="noteBox">
		<ul>
			<li>the table always looses focus when the instant hand history is opend for the first time.
				this is to be expected.
			<li>the instant hand history takes away the focus of the table when activated. so TableCrab
				clicks the point <b>EmptySpace</b> on the table to restore the focus. make shure
				the replayer does not pop up at this location. long and winding explanation here ..no,
				i can not restore focus programatically. linux/wine does not suport this.
		</ul>
