<div class="textBox">
	<div class="headerBox">Hotkey Instant hand History</div>

	this hotkey clicks the instant hand history button at the table. use it to open/refresh the instant hand history.
	
	<div class="noteBox">
		<ul>
			<li>the table always looses focus when the instant hand history is opend for the first time. this is to be expected.
			<li>the instant hand history takes away the focus of the table when activated. so TableCrab auto-clicks a point (1, 1) on the table
				to restore the focus. make shure the replayer does not pop up at this location. long and winding explanation here ..no,
				i can not restore focus programatically cos some linux oses don't allow to do so.
		</ul>
