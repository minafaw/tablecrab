<div class="textBox">
	<div class="headerBox">Hotkey Table Size Next</div>

	whenever you hit this key the current table will be resized to the size of the next template
	on the <a href="setup.html">Setup</a> tab.  for example, if you have two or more templates of
	differing sizes you can use this hotkey to adjust tables sizes on the fly.


	<div class="noteBox">
		<ul>
			<li>linux users: cycling through table sizes may not always work. i found that some window
				managers do not allow resizing a window &gt; than desktop size. this will result in the cycling
					to come to a halt at the maximum size. you may want to remove the offending template
					or disable it by prefixing its name with &quot;disabled&quot;.
			<li>linux users: this hotkey is not working in <b>wine-1.1.4.2</b> up to <b>wine-1.3.0</b>.
				you may have to up- or downgrade wine.
